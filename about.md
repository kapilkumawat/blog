title: About
---

I live in Pune, India and since Oct 2008 I'm working as a Software Engineer in a multinational IT Services provider. I am a foodie and love taking pictures. I also love to travel, meet new people and have visited 9 countries so far.

In my IT career, I've mostly worked around data driven applications in power sector and web content measurement domains. In the last few years I've designed and implemented a few bigdata processing systems in Hadoop and Spark, both, in premise and in the cloud (Amazon).

When I write code, I usually do it in Java or Scala but I've also had to do Python, php and JavaScript professionally.
